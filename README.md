# Social-Media-Impact-on-Workplace-Productivity
# Overview

This data science project explores how social media habits influence workplace productivity, job satisfaction, and digital wellbeing. Using a dataset of 30,000 survey responses, the analysis identifies behavioral trends, productivity perception gaps, and potential organizational risks associated with screen time, social platform preferences, and digital distractions.

# Problem Statement

Increased screen time and constant connectivity have raised concerns about productivity in the workplace. This study aims to understand how specific digital behaviors relate to both perceived and actual productivity, burnout, and satisfaction.

# Objectives

Analyze the relationship between social media usage and productivity metrics
Evaluate how behavioral patterns (notifications, platform preference, screen time) affect job satisfaction and wellbeing
Derive actionable insights to improve digital work habits

# Dataset Summary

Source: Simulated workplace behavioral data
Records: 30,000
Variables: 19 (demographics, behavioral metrics, productivity scores, wellness indicators)
File Format: CSV

# Tools & Technologies

Power BI: Visualization and dashboard creation
Excel: Data preprocessing and cleanup
DAX: Calculated measures for KPI insights
# Key Steps

# 1. Data Cleaning
    Capitalized column headers
    Handled missing values in wellness and productivity fields
    Created calculated fields (e.g., Productivity Gap = Perceived - Actual)
    
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Segmented results by gender, age group, and platform use
    Compared actual vs perceived productivity
    Identified trends in screen time and job satisfaction

# 3. Insights & Patterns
    Higher screen time correlates with lower actual productivity
    LinkedIn/Twitter users show better output than TikTok/Instagram users
    Excessive notifications reduce concentration and output
    Digital wellbeing adoption is low but highly beneficial

# Visuals Included

    Productivity by Gender
    Platform Preference vs Screen Time and Productivity
    Work Hours vs Output
    Productivity Gap Analysis
    Notification Overload Impact

# Recommendations

    Encourage use of digital wellbeing tools and focus apps
    Reduce unnecessary notifications
    Promote awareness of productivity perception gaps
    Tailor interventions based on platform preference
    Support employee wellness to reduce burnout

# Conclusion

This analysis highlights the complex relationship between social media behaviors and workplace productivity. While social media can offer value and connectivity, excessive use—especially on entertainment-focused platforms—negatively impacts output and satisfaction. The project emphasizes the importance of digital wellbeing practices, such as managing screen time, reducing distractions, and adopting focus-enhancing tools. Organizations that embrace these insights can better align employee habits with productivity goals.
